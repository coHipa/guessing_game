# Guessing Game

## There are many GuessingGames out there but this one is mine.
The base game is copied from the [Learn Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html).
I try to add some own ideas like:
- limited guesses using player health
- counting attempts

## Working on
- fights against smaller enemys and bosses

## Future ideas
- inventory/items
- loot system

Please keep in mind I'm a complete programming beginner. I need a lot of time for this work.
